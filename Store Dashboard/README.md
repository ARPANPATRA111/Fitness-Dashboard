## **1. What is Data Analytics?**  

> **Data Analytics = Using data to understand situations, answer questions, and make better decisions.**  

**Example:**  
Imagine a **doctor diagnosing a patient**:  

- The doctor **collects data** (symptoms, history),  
- **Finds the cause** (diagnosis),  
- **Suggests actions** (medicine, lifestyle changes).  

**Data analytics works the same way — just with numbers instead of patients.**  

## **2. The Data Analytics Workflow**  

A well-structured approach generally follows these **6 steps**:  

1. **Define the Question / Problem**  
   - Clearly state what you want to solve or learn.  
   - *Example:* *"Why are sales dropping in the northern region?"*

2. **Collect Relevant Data**  
   - Gather reliable data from surveys, databases, APIs, or files.

3. **Clean and Prepare Data**  
   - Fix errors, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.  
   - *Example:* Correcting inconsistent Google Form entries.

4. **Analyze and Model**  
   - Use statistical techniques or machine learning to uncover trends.

5. **Visualize and Interpret**  
   - Present results with **charts, dashboards, or reports** for clarity.

6. **Take Action and Monitor**  
   - Implement decisions and track results over time.

## **3. Types of Data Analytics**  

During the workshop, we explored **four major types** of analytics, with medical analogies for better understanding:  

- **📘 Descriptive — *What happened?***  
  Summarizes past events.  
  *Patient explains past symptoms to the doctor.*  

- **🔍 Diagnostic — *Why did it happen?***  
  Identifies causes.  
  *Doctor runs tests to find the reason.*  

- **📈 Predictive — *What might happen next?***  
  Forecasts future outcomes.  
  *Doctor predicts illness progression if untreated.*  

- **💡 Prescriptive — *What should we do about it?***  
  Suggests specific actions.  
  *Doctor prescribes medicine and lifestyle changes.*  

## **4. Tools Explored in the Workshop**  

### **Microsoft Excel**  

- **Pivot Tables** → Summarize large datasets.  
- **Charts & Graphs** → Visualize patterns and trends.  
- **Hands-On Practice:** Created **5 charts** using Kaggle's *Superstore* dataset.  

### **Microsoft Power BI**  

- **Introduction to Power BI Interface & Features**  
- **Dashboard Creation:** Built a live, interactive dashboard.  

## **5. My Personal Project 🚀**  

While the instructor assisted others, I **built my own Power BI dashboard** using the workshop dataset.  

- Reinforced concepts immediately.  
- Gained confidence in **connecting datasets** and **designing visuals**.  

## **6. Career Guidance & Future Opportunities**  

The session concluded with **practical advice for aspiring data analysts**:  

- **Key Skills to Focus On:**  
  - Excel, SQL, Power BI / Tableau  
  - Data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling  
  - Building **real-world projects** for your portfolio  

- **Future Scope:**  
  - Data Analytics roles are **rapidly expanding** across industries.  
  - Continuous learning and **staying updated** with tools is essential.
